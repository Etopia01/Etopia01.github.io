        <section>
            <p>Hi my name is <strong>Elisha Ola</strong> and I'm an Year 12 A-Level student doing work experience at <strong>Arup</strong>.
                What I really love about Arup is how so many differnt people fromm differnet backgrounds all across the world come together to build such incredible things for the environment.
                Arup has helped designed a flagship engine production plant for <em>Jaguar Land Rover</em> and were able to produce <em>300,000 engines per year</em>, also they also helped support <em>BCC</em> with desgin, plannig and texhnical expertise to expand <strong>Alexander Stadium</strong> increasing the size capacity by <em>40%</em>.
                Arup is a great place where inovative minds come together to build extraordinary things that solify their workds and prjects in time. 
                My dream is to become a <em>software engineer</em> and as a soon to be software engineer I would love to work at Arup to use my mind to create amazing things not just by myslef but with Arup solidifying all our work in time for future generations to see.
            </p>
